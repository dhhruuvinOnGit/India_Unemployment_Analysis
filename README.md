# India_Unemployment_Analysis
This is a data analysis project based on a sample dataset that contains state-wise and region-wise rate of employment and unemployment.

I've uploaded my .ipynb file here to refer to the code and insights. Dataset is also uploaded that has been used for this project.
Please note that this is just a basic and simple, beginner-level data analysis project.
